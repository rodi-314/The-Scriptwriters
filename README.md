# The Scriptwriters

This group project was completed as part of the CP2106: Independent Software Development Project taught at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Orbital (a.k.a., CP2106: Independent Software Development Project) is the School of Computingâ€™s 1st year summer self-directed, independent work course. In this course, the students work in teams of two to pick up software development skills on their own, and complete a small scale software project of their choice in an iterative software development life cycle. All students are to invest at least 130 nominal hours of effort into the project, and the completed project are classified into several different level of achievements. For more informtion and details about our project, view the full README [here](<README.pdf>). 

## Introduction to The Scriptwriters

Music is an integral yet often underappreciated aspect of our lives. In our increasingly superficial world powered by the brevity and speed of social media and the Internet, Music is becoming increasingly diluted to suit the masses, and taken for granted. To this end, we aimed to create an immersive and engaging mobile game to reconnect people with culture and the historical origins of music from various parts of the world, for them to go back to their roots, and gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for music.

Our goal was to create a musical top-down 2D RPG mobile adventure game with the following characteristics:
- Free exploration
- Maps covering different regions of the parallel universe where users can explore music of different cultures (e.g., Western (European) classical music, Chinese music, Malay music, Indian music, Indonesian music, etc.)
- Quest-guided gameplay
- NPCs
- Interactive items

Awarded Apollo 11 (Advanced) for Orbital. An Apollo 11 (Advanced) certificate is issued to the students who have not only completed a good application with a good set of core features and extensions, but also demonstrated some effort in following good software engineering practices and principles.
